FIX: "Start in Creation Mode" preference is now properly saved
FIX: Fixed computation of sample directions if the SplineComputer component's transform has a negative scale
FIX: Fixed incorrect behavior of SplinePositioner.SetPercent when mode is set to Distance, and SplinePositioner.SetDistance when mode is set to Percent
FIX: Fixed MeshGenerator baking removing the generated mesh object if the object is child of the SplineComputer it references
FIX: Fixed the NullReference exception when baking meshes with the Save To File option
FIX: Fixed Insert point creation mode offsetting the last point of the spline when the point is inserted before the last point


----- 3.0.4 -----
FIX: Trigger positions are now preserved when spline points are added / removed in the editor
FIX: Fixed Spline Tracer objects going to origin if their spline doesn't have samples
FIX: Fixed disappearing samples in Optimized spline mode
FIX: Improved the Optimized sample mode to respect the spline object transform scale in Local space mode
FIX: Fixed an issue where using the delete point tool clears the spline samples
FIX: Fixed spline samples clearing when using the right click + left click shortcut to exit point creation mode
FIX: Fixed disconnecting nodes when using the Insert point method


----- 3.0.3 -----
FIX: Fixed the create point tool when drag-clicking Bezier points. It now properly sets the tangents.
FIX: Fixed an issue with the SplineRenderer throwing NullReferenceExceptions
FIX: Fixed TextMeshProController not properly updating the Canvas (when working with UGUI) 
FIX: Fixed errors when the Spline Computer is in Optimized, Linear mode and it only has two control points

----- 3.0.2 -----
FIX: Fixed the spline primitives in the editor
FIX: Fixed the misalignment of point sizes and point normals 


----- 3.0.1 -----
FIX: Backwards compatibility fix for projects with Dreamteck Splines 2

----- 3.0.0 -----

FEATURE: Support for Text Mesh Pro!
FEATURE: Added Catmull Rom Spline parametrization - Uniform, Centripetal and Chordal splines with the move of a slider
FEATURE: Added a "Draw Transform Pivot" option in the Editor properties of the Spline Computer
FEATURE: Added a feature to compensate for tight corners when under the "Common" foldout of the mesh generators
FEATURE: Added a Catenary Tool to generate sagging cables in Window/Dreamteck/Splines/Tools
FEATURE: Added Node buttons inside the Spline Computer point editing panel in the inspector to easily create and delete nodes for each point
FEATURE: Added a "Mode" property to the follower speed modifiers which allows switch between addition and multiplication
FEATURE: The Spline Follower now supports negative speed which will make it go backwards - easier than setting the direction property
FEATURE: Added a "Rotate Degrees" normal operation wich allows the user to rotate spline normals with specific degrees
FEATURE: Added a "Use Clipped Percents" property to the sample modifiers to make them move with the clip range instead of being global
FEATURE: Added a "Sideways UV Rotation" property to the Surface Generator to rotate the UVS of the side walls when extruded
FEATURE: Added a follow target feature to the spline positioner. The spline positioner can now be attached to another spline tracer

FIX: Substantially reduced the Spline Mesh component's garbage generation
FIX: The Spline Positioner now calls onNode when being moved and a node is passed
FIX: Numerous runtime performance improvements
FIX: Editor performance improvements
FIX: Performance improvements when working with prefabs
FIX: Stability improvements when working with prefabs
FIX: Calling SplineComputer.SetPointPosition now properly handles the point tangents
FIX: Fixed the behavior of duplicating spline objects where sometimes the duplicated object will get affected when the original is edited
FIX: Setting applyPosition and applyRotation of the SplineTracer motion property now works properly in 2D mode
FIX: Fixed IndexOutOfRange exception when using a TubeGenerator with caps and there are no samples in the spline
FIX: Fixed an issue with SplineUser.Evaluate returning wrong results when the clip range is different than [0-1]
FIX: Reduced the amount of serialization for spline objects and memory footprint - scene sizes will be smaller
FIX: Fixed the serialization of sample modifiers inside the SplineUsers 
FIX: Fixed the blend value of sample modifiers - it works properly for all kinds of modifiers now
FIX: Improved the Particle Controller's birth detection logic
FIX: Fixed the point normal editing tool when working with B-Splines
FIX: Fixed an issue where sometimes spline objects were not being initialized properly in the scenes unless selected
FIX: Nodes are no longer set dirty upon just selecting them in the editor
FIX: The Node editor now properly draws the scene handles (regression fix)
FIX: Fixed the Spline Follower's speed regions not matching the clip range if the clip range is different than 0-1
FIX: Fixed a core fault in SplineComputer.CalculateSamples()
FIX: Fixed an issue with the UV rotation of the Surface Generator not working
FIX: The EdgeColliderGenerator's offset property is now exposed in the editor
FIX: Mesh generators are now properly marked as dirty if the bake option is used
FIX: Fixed the Waveform Generator to make proper use of the sample modifiers

CHANGE: The "Vertices" foldout of the Mesh Generator components has been renamed to "Common"
CHANGE: Removed the rebuildOnAwake property from the SplineComputer - splines are now handles automatically when instantiated in runtime
CHANGE: Closing a spline now bridges the gap between the first and last points instead of bringing both points together

API: Added the SplineUtility static class. It provides useful methods like merging
API: The Evaluate method should now be called with the "ref" keyword. Example: spline.Evaluate(0.5, ref sample);
API: Added wrapper methods for adding and getting triggers and trigger groups from a Spline Computer (see documentation)
API: Added RemoveListener and RemoveAllListeners methods to the SplineTrigger class
API: Removed the onUserCross event from SplineTrigger. The onCrossEvent now passes a reference to the user by default

SUPPORT: Official Unity 2022 Support
